# Analysis Examples

We provide two examples for analysing wearables data as shown in the PHD paper. The `LogisticRegressionExample.ipynb` provides the preprocessing and analysis code for training and evaluating a regularized logistic regression model on deidentified wearables data. The `UMAPExample.ipynb` provised the preprocessing and analysis code to run an exploratory analysis of the users' wearables featurespace.

In order to run both code examples, first download the wearables data from the [cloud bucket](https://www.google.com). Make sure to edit the `PATH` variable in both notebooks to point to the data directory.
